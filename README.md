# Hybrid-Wide-Area-Human-Action-Analysis-System

This is the source code for the reviewed TIM paper, titled "Efficient Uncertainty Estimation for Hybrid Wide-Area Human Action Analysis System".
The code includes C++ implementation of Camera data reading, galvanomirror controller, object searching, and human action analysis.



The basic model can be searched online.
You can email me to get these weights and configurations.
These models include:
- Yolov3
- Yolov4
- Yolov7
- Yolov8
- Yolo-nas-m
- also with their tiny version.

You need to download the OpenCV library for image processing, GenICam for camera control, and Infra and Memory for source image stream management.
